"Charles Burney  (7 April 1726 – 12 April 1814) was an English music historian, composer and musician. Charles Burney was the father of the writers Frances Burney and Sarah Burney, of the explorer James Burney, and of Charles Burney, a classicist and book donor to the British Museum. ",0
== Early life and career == ,1
"Charles Burney was born at Raven Street, Shrewsbury, the fourth of six children of James Macburney (1678–1749), a musician, dancer and portrait painter, and James Macburney (1678–1749), a musician, dancer and portrait painter's second wife Ann (née Cooper, c. 1690–1775). In childhood Charles Burney and a brother Richard (1723–1792) were for unknown reasons sent to the care of a ""Nurse Ball"" at nearby Condover, where he and a brother Richard (1723–1792) lived until 1739. Charles Burney began formal education at Shrewsbury School in 1737 and was later sent in 1739 to The King's School, Chester, where Charles Burney's father then lived and worked. Charles Burney's first music master was a Mr Baker, the cathedral organist, and a pupil of Dr John Blow. Returning to Shrewsbury at the age of 15, Charles Burney continued Charles Burney's musical studies for three years under Charles Burney's half-brother, James Burney, organist of St Mary's Church, and was then sent to London as a pupil of Dr Thomas Arne for three years. Charles Burney wrote some music for Thomson's Alfred, which was produced at Drury Lane Theatre on 30 March 1745. In 1749 Charles Burney was appointed organist of St Dionis Backchurch, Fenchurch Street, with a salary of £30 a year. According to the voting book, Charles Burney secured organist of St Dionis Backchurch, Fenchurch Street against six other candidates with votes 50 to 4. Charles Burney was also engaged to take the harpsichord in the ""New Concerts"" then recently established at the King's Arms, Cornhill. It was for Charles Burney's health that Charles Burney went in 1751 to Lynn Regis in Norfolk, where Charles Burney was elected organist, with an annual salary of £100. Charles Burney lived there for nine years. During nine years Charles Burney began to entertain the idea of writing a general history of music. Charles Burney's Ode for St Cecilia's Day was performed at Ranelagh Gardens in 1759. In 1760 Charles Burney returned to London in good health and with a young family. Charles Burney's eldest child, Esther, a girl of eight, surprised the public with His eldest child, Esther, a girl of eight,'s achievements as a harpsichord player. The concertos for harpsichord which Charles Burney published soon after Charles Burney's return to London were much admired. In 1766 Charles Burney produced, at Drury Lane Theatre, a translation and adaptation of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's opera Le Devin du village, under the title of The Cunning Man. ",2
== Family and social life == ,3
"In 1749, while working as an organist and harpsichordist in London, Charles married Esther Sleepe. The couple had six children: Esther or Hetty, who later became Mrs Burney on marrying her cousin Charles Rousseau Burney, the explorer James Burney, the celebrated writer Frances Burney (often called Fanny), Susan (Susy), Charlotte (later Mrs Francis), and Charles. ",4
"As vividly recorded by Fanny, the family moved in a lively cultural circle in London, which included the portrait painter Sir Joshua Reynolds, the lexicographer Samuel Johnson, the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the composer Harriet Wainwright, the essayist Edmund Burke and the MP for Southwark Henry Thrale, whose wife Hester Thrale was a close friend of Fanny's. ",5
"Charles's's first wife Esther died in 1761. In 1767 Charles's was this union a second time, to Elizabeth Allen (Mrs Stephen Allen) of Lynn. From this union Charles's had a son, Richard Thomas, and a daughter, Sarah Harriet Burney, who became a novelist. ",6
"The University of Oxford honoured Burney, on 23 June 1769, with the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Music, and Burney's own work was performed. his own work consisted of an anthem, with an overture, solos, recitatives and choruses, accompanied by instruments, besides a vocal anthem in eight parts, which was not performed. In 1769 Burney published An essay towards a history of the principal comets that have appeared since 1742. Amidst Burney's various professional avocations, Burney never lost sight of Burney's main project, Burney's History of Music. Burney decided to travel abroad and collect materials that could not be found in Britain. Burney left London in June 1770, carrying numerous letters of introduction, and travelled to Paris, Geneva, Turin, Milan, Padua, Venice, Bologna (where Burney met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart), Florence, Rome and Naples. The results of Burney's observations were published in a well-received book, The Present State of Music in France and Italy (1771). In July 1772 Burney again visited France and Italy to do further research, and on Burney's return to London published an account of Burney's tour under the title The Present State of Music in Germany, the Netherlands and United Provinces (1773). In 1773 Burney was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. ",8
"In 1776 appeared the first volume (in quarto) of Burney's's long-projected History of Music. In 1782 Burney's published Burney's's second volume; and in 1789 the third and fourth. Burney's long-projected History of Music was generally well received, although criticized by Forkel in Germany and by the Spanish ex-Jesuit, Requeno, who in his Saggj sul Ristabilimento dell' Arte Armonica de' Greci e Romani Canton (Parma, 1798) attacked Burney's's account of ancient Greek music and called Burney's lo scompigliato Burney (the confused Burney). his second volume covers the birth and development of opera and the musical scene in England in Burney's's time. Burney's's first tour was translated into German by Christoph Daniel Ebeling, and printed at Hamburg in 1772. Burney's's second tour, translated into German by Johann Joachim Christoph Bode, was published at Hamburg in 1773. A Dutch translation of Burney's's second tour, with notes by J. W. Lustig, organist at Groningen, was published there in 1786. The Dissertation on the Music of the Ancients, in the first volume of Burney's's History, was translated into German by Johann Joachim Eschenburg, and printed at Leipzig, 1781. Burney's derived much aid from the first two volumes of Padre Martini's very learned Storia della Musica (Bologna, 1757–1770). ",9
"In 1774 he had written A Plan for a Music School. In 1779 he wrote for the Royal Society an account of the young William Crotch, whose remarkable musical talent excited so much attention at that time. In 1784 he published, with an Italian title page, the music annually performed in the Pope's chapel at Rome during Passion Week. In 1785 he published, for the benefit of the Musical Fund, an account of the first commemoration of George Friedrich Handel in Westminster Abbey in the preceding year, with a life of George Friedrich Handel. In 1796 he published Memoirs and Letters of Metastasio. ",10
"Towards the close of Burney's life Burney was paid £1000 for contributing to Rees's's Cyclopædia all the musical articles not belonging to the department of natural philosophy and mathematics. all the musical articles not belonging to the department of natural philosophy and mathematics were written by John Farey, Sr and Jr. Burney's contribution to Rees's included much new material which had not appeared in Burney's earlier writings, particularly about the London music scene then. In 1783, through the treasury influence of Burney's friend Edmund Burke, Burney was appointed organist to the chapel of Chelsea Hospital. Burney moved there from St Martin's Street, Leicester Square and remained there for the rest of Burney's life. In 1810, Burney was made a member of the Institute of France and nominated a correspondent in the class of the fine arts. From 1806 until Burney's death Burney enjoyed a pension of £300 granted by Charles James Fox. Burney died at Chelsea College on 12 April 1814, and was interred in the burial ground of Chelsea College. A tablet was erected to Burney's memory in Westminster Abbey. ",11
Burney's library was sold at auction by John White of Westminster beginning on 8 August 1814. ,12

"Burney's's portrait was painted by Reynolds in 1781 for Henry Thrale's library. Burney's's bust was cut by Nollekens in 1805. Burney's also appears in James Barry's The Thames (also known as Triumph of Navigation), which was painted in 1791 for the Royal Society of Arts. Burney's had a wide circle of acquaintance among the distinguished artists and literary men of Burney's's day. At one time Burney's thought of writing a life of Burney's's friend Dr Samuel Johnson, but retired before the crowd of biographers who rushed into that field. ",14
"Burney's's eldest son, James Burney, was a distinguished officer in the Royal Navy, who died a rear-admiral in 1821, having accompanied Captain Cook on Captain Cook's last two voyages. Burney's's second son was the Rev. Charles Burney, a major donor of books to the British Museum, and Burney's's second daughter was Frances or Fanny, the novelist, later Madame D'Arblay. Frances or Fanny, the novelist, later Madame D'Arblay's published diary and letters contain many minute and interesting particulars of Frances or Fanny, the novelist, later Madame D'Arblay's father's public and private life, and of Burney's's friends and contemporaries, including Burney's's initial opposition to Frances or Fanny, the novelist, later Madame D'Arblay's marriage to the French refugee Alexandre D'Arblay in 1793 and to Frances or Fanny, the novelist, later Madame D'Arblay's sister Charlotte's remarriage to the pamphleteer and stock jobber Ralph Broome in 1798. A life of Burney's was compiled by Frances or Fanny, the novelist, later Madame D'Arblay and appeared in 1832, but A life of Burney has been criticized consistently for being eulogistic. Burney's's daughter by Burney's's second marriage, Sarah Burney, was likewise a novelist. His daughter by his second marriage, Sarah Burney,'s letters provide interesting, less adulatory information about His daughter by his second marriage, Sarah Burney,'s father. Although His daughter by his second marriage, Sarah Burney, looked after Burney's in Burney's's old age, their personal relations remained poor. ",15

"Dr Johnson drew inspiration from The Present State of Music in France and Italy (1771), according to later writers: ""Dr Johnson published an account of Dr Johnson's tour... which was extremely well received, and deemed by the best judges so good a model for travellers who were inclined to give a description of what travellers who were inclined to give a description of what they had seen or observed had seen or observed, that Dr Johnson professedly imitated that clever dog Burney's Musical Tour in Dr Johnson's own Tour of the Hebrides, saying, 'Dr Johnson had Dr Johnson's Musical Tour in Dr Johnson's eye. '""Dr Johnson appears in a story by Lillian de la Torre (Lillian Bueno McCue, 1902–1993), a US writer of historical mysteries, entitled ""The Viotti Stradivarius"", part of Lillian de la Torre (Lillian Bueno McCue, 1902–1993), a US writer of historical mysteries's series featuring Samuel Johnson as a ""detector"" (detective). The story features a fictitious meeting between Dr Johnson, Dr Johnson's daughter Fanny, Giovanni Battista Viotti and Dr Johnson's Stradivarius, and Grigory Grigoryevich Orlov, along with Dr Johnson and James Boswell, in connection with the theft and recovery of the Grigory Grigoryevich Orlov diamond.
