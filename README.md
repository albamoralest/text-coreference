# Coreference text from PERIODICAL's sample biographies

A repository created to store a list of biographies, their text and the corresponding coreference text. We used the fastcoref library, part of the spacy pipeline for the coreference task.

The code for obtaining the coreference text is available in the 2-process-coreference.ipynb notebook

For the list of biographies processed check: matching_bios.csv

Results can be found in the folder results-coref-text. Each file represents a biography, the name is the corresponding DBpedia id.
